## Privacy Policy

### Data Collection

We do not collect any information in the sense that we do not publish it anywhere.
We only use the data you knowingly enter to be stored in a cookie to use the MyAnimeList or Kitsu API.
This data is only stored locally and nowhere else, so it is not shared with anybody.
It cannot be requested as we do not have access to it outside of your machine.

### Help

If you have any questions at all, you can ask anything at all since this is an open source plugin on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/TSedlar/anitrack/issues).
